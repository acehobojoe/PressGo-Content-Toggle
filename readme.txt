A simple content toggle for Elementor. It uses content templates to toggle a section.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create a toggle section with a simple slider. This is useful for things like pricing tables and other widgets that need to compare two different versions of a similar element.

To use the toggle switch, just install and activate the plugin and drag the new "toggle slider" widget that appears in your elementor side menu.

use a template shortcode from the "templates" section of your website if you use elementor. If you don't use elementor, don't use this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `PressGo-Content-Toggle` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I toggle a pricing table widget? =

Create your pricing table widget as a template first. Use the "templates" sidebar in wp-admin if you have installed elementor.
Create a new template and create a small pricing table. Once you've created this, do it again but change the prices to reflect a yearly or monthly option.
You can now go to the templates menu and copy the shortcodes for the templates and use them with the content toggler.

= What about a text section or image? =

We will add functionality for this at a later date.
